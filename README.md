Aim
Write a C++ program to display "Hello, World!"

Build a simple calculator to perform the following operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Objectives
Understand the structure and flow of a basic C++ program

Learn how to use cout for output and cin for user input

Get comfortable using variables and arithmetic operators

Practice code clarity through meaningful logic and output

Build logic using step-wise execution (algorithmic thinking)

Tools Used
Programming Language: C++

Compiler: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)

Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code

Operating System: Windows 10

Algorithm Explanation
Hello World Program
Start the program

Print the word "Hello"

Print the sentence "World, let's do cpp" on a new line

End the program

Calculator Program
Start the program

Declare variables:

num1 and num2 as float (for user input)

sum, sub, mult as int (for integer results)

divi as float (for division result)

Prompt the user to enter the first number

Read the first number using cin

Prompt the user to enter the second number

Read the second number using cin

Calculate the sum → sum = num1 + num2

Display the sum

Calculate the difference → sub = num1 - num2

Display the subtraction result

Calculate the product → mult = num1 * num2

Display the multiplication result

Calculate the division → divi = num1 / num2

Display the division result

End the program

Conclusion
In this experiment, the fundamentals of writing and running a C++ program were practiced.
The "Hello World" program introduced basic syntax and output functions, while the calculator program emphasized arithmetic operations and input handling.
The step-by-step logic applied in both programs built a strong foundation for future experiments involving conditional statements, loops, and functions.
