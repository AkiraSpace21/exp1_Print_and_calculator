## ðŸ“˜ Algorithm Explanation

### âž¤ Hello World Program

1. Start the program  
2. Print the word **"Hello"**  
3. Print the sentence **"World, let's do cpp"** on a new line  
4. End the program

### âž¤ Calculator Program

1. Start the program  
2. Declare variables:
   - `num1`, `num2` â†’ for user input (as `float`)
   - `sum`, `sub`, `mult` â†’ to store results (as `int`)
   - `divi` â†’ to store division result (as `float`)
3. Prompt the user to enter the first number  
4. Read the first number using `cin`  
5. Prompt the user to enter the second number  
6. Read the second number using `cin`  
7. Calculate and store the sum â†’ `sum = num1 + num2`  
8. Display the result of addition  
9. Calculate and store the difference â†’ `sub = num1 - num2`  
10. Display the result of subtraction  
11. Calculate and store the product â†’ `mult = num1 * num2`  
12. Display the result of multiplication  
13. Calculate and store the division â†’ `divi = num1 / num2`  
14. Display the result of division  
15. End the program

## âœ… Conclusion

This experiment helped reinforce the basics of writing and executing C++ programs.  
The **Hello World** program provided an introduction to `cout` and the structure of a C++ program.  
The **calculator** allowed practice with arithmetic operators, variable handling, and user input using `cin`.  
These exercises form the essential foundation for building more complex programs in future experiments.
