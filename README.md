🔢 C++ Experiment 1: Hello World & Basic Calculator
🎯 Aim
✅ Write a C++ program to display "Hello, World!"
✅ Build a simple calculator to perform:
  ➕ Addition
  ➖ Subtraction
  ✖️ Multiplication
  ➗ Division

🧠 Objectives
📌 Understand the structure and flow of a basic C++ program
📌 Learn how to use cout for output and cin for user input
📌 Get comfortable using variables and arithmetic operators
📌 Practice code clarity through meaningful logic and output
📌 Build logic using step-wise execution (algorithmic thinking)

🛠️ Tools Used
Programming Language: C++

Compiler: g++ (GNU Compiler Collection)

Editor/IDE: Visual Studio Code

Operating System: Windows 10

📃 Algorithm Explanation
🖥️ Hello World Program
Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Print the word "Hello"
Step 3: Print the sentence "World, let's do cpp" on a new line
Step 4: End the program

🧮 Calculator Program
Step 1: Start the program
Step 2: Declare variables:

num1 and num2 for user input (as float)

sum, sub, mult (as int)

divi for division result (as float)

Step 3: Prompt the user to enter the first number
Step 4: Read the first number using cin
Step 5: Prompt the user to enter the second number
Step 6: Read the second number using cin
Step 7: Calculate the sum → sum = num1 + num2
Step 8: Display the sum
Step 9: Calculate the difference → sub = num1 - num2
Step 10: Display the subtraction result
Step 11: Calculate the product → mult = num1 * num2
Step 12: Display the multiplication result
Step 13: Calculate the division → divi = num1 / num2
Step 14: Display the division result
Step 15: End the program

✅ Conclusion
This experiment helped reinforce the basic structure of a C++ program and gave practical exposure to writing, compiling, and executing simple logic.
The Hello World program introduced standard output operations, and the calculator logic strengthened my understanding of user input and arithmetic handling.
Overall, it was a great starting point to build confidence in writing functional C++ programs using Visual Studio Code.
